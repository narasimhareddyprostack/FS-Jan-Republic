    <h1>About Bangalore</h1>
    <p>
        Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern Karnataka state. The center of India's
        high-tech industry, the city is also known for its parks and nightlife. By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha is a
        Neo-Dravidian legislative building. Former royal residences include 19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after
        <a href="#">England’s</a> Windsor Castle, and Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure.
